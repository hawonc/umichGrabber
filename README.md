grab tour dates for umich

So when I recieved my acceptance letter from UMich, I wanted to visit their LSA's campus day tour. 
This is an extremely simple bot without automatic date/time/name filled out because I literally do not know what the screen looks like

Anyways this is also my first project with Selenium so if it looks terrible that's why

Make sure to save the selenium webdriver for your chrome version in C:/SeleniumDrivers, or edit the code so its wherever u placed it

Create an email/password and replace the 'mail@mail.com' and the 'password'
